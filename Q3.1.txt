Simple solution:

Assuming you want n stacks we split the array into n equal partitions.
We would also have n index variables in an array to keep track of the 'top' element of each stacks
If the index ever exceeds the partition size we return an error.

Dynamic solution:
Again split the array into n equal partitions.
Store metadata with the start index, size and capacity
Allow start + size to be a valid index by allowing wrap around
If an attempted push exceeds stack capacity and there is still room in the main array, shift all neighbouring 
    stacks to free up one space
